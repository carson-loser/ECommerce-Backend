# E-Commerce Back End

#### By Carson Loser

#### This application is designed to mimic a successful ECommerce business and its database

# Prerequisites and Dependencies

* User needs to be able to add a database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to environment variable file.

* This .env file should allow the user to connect to the database using Sequelize.

* When the user enters schema and seed commands, a database is created and is seeded with testing data.

* When the command to start the application is entered, the server starts and the sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

* When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products and tags, the data for each of these three routes is displayed in formatted JSON.

* When the user tests POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, each one performs their respected action accordingly in the database.

* When the user clicks on the write icon, a new empty note prompt is displayed where the user can start the process over.
